# 100hz RVC firmware for All-In-One v5.0x
### *** very alpha testing/dev stage ***

### To Do
too many to list, much many changes coming

### To Contribute
There is a lot of active dev work expected in the next few months. The planned work flow for contributing is to create a branch from main, make some changes/improvments and create a pull request back to main but for now if you have a feature request it might be better to create an issue so that there's a log and we don't forget about it.
